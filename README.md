#PRODIGY_ML_04

Project Summary: Hand Gesture Recognition
Objective:
Develop a model to accurately identify and classify hand gestures from images or video data, facilitating intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

Steps:

Set Up the Environment:

Import necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow/Keras.
Load and Explore the Dataset:

Load the dataset from Kaggle, which contains images of various hand gestures. List and preview the gesture classes and sample images.
Preprocess the Data:

Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 64x64 pixels).
Normalize image pixel values.
Encode gesture labels into categorical format.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Data Augmentation (Optional):

Apply transformations like rotation, shifting, and horizontal flipping to enhance model generalization.
Build the CNN Model:

Construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers.
Add fully connected layers and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.
Train the Model:

Train the model using the augmented training data and validate it with the test set over a specified number of epochs.
Evaluate the Model:

Assess model performance on the test set, checking accuracy and loss.
Save the Model:

Save the trained model to a file for future use or deployment.
Visualize Training Results:

Plot accuracy and loss curves to understand the training and validation performance.
Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images and compare them with actual labels.
Outcome:
The project results in a trained CNN model capable of classifying hand gestures from images. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated, and predictions on new data are visualized to assess its accuracy and effectiveness.
